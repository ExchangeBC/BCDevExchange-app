            <h2>What is a Digital Resource?</h2>
            <p>
                Digital resources are software <strong>code</strong>, <strong>data</strong> and application programing
                interfaces (<strong>APIs</strong>).
            </p>
            <h2>What sort of resources does BCDevExchange list?</h2>
            <p>
                The BCDevExchange lists B.C. public sector digital resources licensed under
                <strong>permissive licenses</strong>, with an initial focus on code and APIs.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <h2>
                Why should I list my organization’s digital resources with the BCDevExchange?
            </h2>
            <p>
                If you want new ways to innovate and meet the needs of those you serve,
                then listing your digital resources makes sense. Why?
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>It makes your digital resources <strong>easier to find</strong> and use by developers and
                    entrepreneurs so they can create services and innovations useful to those you serve.</li>
                <li>It creates <strong>new ways</strong> to solve your business problems with faster IT development.</li>
                <li>It <strong>connects</strong> you with experienced and skilled
                    <strong>entrepreneurs and developers</strong> in B.C.’s tech and startup community.</li>
            </ul>

                    <br>
                    Currently, there are two ways to list your digital resources on the BCDevExchange.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you have a digital resource in a GitHub repo, send us an <a href="mailto:Data@gov.bc.ca">email</a>
                    or <a href="https://github.com/BCDevExchange/BCDevExchange-Resources/issues">create an Issue in our GitHub Resources Repo</a>
                    , and we’ll work with you to get it listed on the BCDevExchange.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you have digital resources in the BC Data Catalogue or elsewhere, we will work with
                        you to determine how to pull those into the BCDevExchange.
                        <a href="mailto:Data@gov.bc.ca">Contact us</a> for more information.
